# C++ Modules Example

These are several examples of using C++ modules in the Clang 8 implementation.

This work was inspired by Bryce Adelstein presentation [Modules are Coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDTm6y6fNSU). You can download its slides [here](https://corecppil.github.io/CoreCpp2019/Keynotes/Bryce_Modules_Are_Coming.pdf).
